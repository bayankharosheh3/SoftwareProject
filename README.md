outer clinic app in react native and php

# Project Name: Clinic

# Project Description:

This project is a mobile application and website that offers a direct way to interact between doctor and patient. It makes booking appointments easier and quicker, provides a place to save medical information, and makes communication easier.

The application is for two types of users: patients and doctors. Patients can use the application to reach all outer clinics, display all doctors, and book appointments. They can find the best doctor with the highest rate in the clinic. They can also see others' reviews about appointments with this doctor. The application gives them the flexibility to cancel the appointment and book again. After the appointment, the patient can see their prescription through their account, and they can add their reviews and rate this appointment. When the patient logs in, the application will ask them questions to list their medical history.

On the doctor's side, they can easily reach their patients and see their information and their medical history. The doctor can make their schedule and select the available time for appointments. Also, in their profile, they can select their bill. In addition, they can display all the past and upcoming appointments with patients. For each past appointment, they can write the prescription. And for the upcoming, they can easily cancel them if they want. If the doctor or the patient cancels the appointment after booking, an announcement will be sent to the other side and will be shown in their profile.
